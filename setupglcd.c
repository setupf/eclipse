This appears to be a code written in C language for interfacing with a GLCD (Graphic LCD) using an LPC214x microcontroller.

The code includes necessary header files, definitions of various pins, and functions required for initializing and operating the GLCD.

The GLCD_Command() function is used to send commands to the GLCD while GLCD_Data() function is used to send data. These functions set and clear various pins based on the command/data sent.

The GLCD_Init() function initializes the GLCD by setting up the direction of various pins, selecting both halves of the display, and sending some initialization commands.

The GLCD_ClearAll() function clears the entire display by setting each pixel to 0.

The GLCD_String() function is used to print a string on the GLCD by calling the GLCD_Data() function in a loop.

Finally, the main() function initializes the VPBDIV register and calls the delay() function before proceeding to call other functions.
